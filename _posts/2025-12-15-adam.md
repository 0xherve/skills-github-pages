# ADAM: First of his Kind

Today marks the launch of ADAM — the first blog for thoughts, experiments, and notes on code, systems, and whatever catches my curiosity. I am learning to use GitHub pages with this blog.

Why "ADAM"?  
It's the starting point; The first commit.

This site is powered entirely by GitHub Pages and Jekyll 

Expect Nothing. 

First principle: Think in commits.

Thanks for stopping by.
